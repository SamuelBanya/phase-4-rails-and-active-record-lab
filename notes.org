* Notes
<2022-10-19 Wed 20:33>: I ran the following commands:
#+begin_src bash
bundle install

learn test
#+end_src

I then created the associated model with the 'rails g' command:
#+begin_src bash
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-4/phase-4-rails-and-active-record-lab $ rails g model Student first_name last_name grade:integer --no-test-framework
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20221020013528_create_students.rb
      create    app/models/student.rb
#+end_src

I then modified the 'app/models/student.rb' related 'Student' model file with the following contents as per the lab's instructions:
#+begin_src ruby
class Student < ApplicationRecord
    # First attempt:
    # def initialize(first_name, last_name, grade)
    #     @first_name = first_name
    #     @last_name = last_name
    #     @grade = grade
    # end

    # Add an instance method Student#to_s which will return the student's first name and last name concatenated with a space between.
    # For example: calling .to_s on a student with a first_name of "Dwayne" and a last_name of "Johnson" should return "Dwayne Johnson".

    # NOTE: Awful hint, doesn't even state that a single string should be returned, very awkward
    def to_s()
        # First Attempt:
        # full_name = @first_name + " " + @last_name
        # full_name
        # Second Attempt
        "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
    end
end
#+end_src

I then ran the related 'rails db:migrate' command accordingly:
#+begin_src ruby
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-4/phase-4-rails-and-active-record-lab $ rails db:migrate
== 20221020013528 CreateStudents: migrating ===================================
-- create_table(:students)
   -> 0.0021s
== 20221020013528 CreateStudents: migrated (0.0021s) ==========================
#+end_src

I then checked my work with the 'rails c' command:
#+begin_src bash
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-4/phase-4-rails-and-active-record-lab $ rails db:migrate

Loading development environment (Rails 6.1.3.1)
2.7.0 :001 > dwayne = Student.new()
   (0.8ms)  SELECT sqlite_version(*)
2.7.0 :002 > dwayne
 => #<Student id: nil, first_name: nil, last_name: nil, grade: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
2.7.0 :003 > dwayne.first_name = "Dwayne"
2.7.0 :004 > dwayne.last_name = "Johnson"
2.7.0 :005 > dwayne.to_s()
 => "Dwayne Johnson"
2.7.0 :006 > exit
#+end_src
